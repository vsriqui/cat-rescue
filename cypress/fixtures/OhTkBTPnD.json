He enjoys being held and will relax in your arms like a furry baby.","life_span":"14 - 15","indoor":0,"lap":1,"alt_names":"Sacred Birman, Sacred Cat Of Burma","adaptability":5,"affection_level":5,"child_friendly":4,"dog_friendly":5,"energy_level":3,"grooming":2,"health_issues":1,"intelligence":3,"shedding_level":3,"social_needs":4,"stranger_friendly":3,"vocalisation":1,"experimental":0,"hairless":0,"natural":0,"rare":0,"rex":0,"suppressed_tail":0,"short_legs":0,"wikipedia_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birman","hypoallergenic":0,"reference_image_id":"HOrX5gwLS"}],"width":1100,"height":1100}
